# Exercise 16 (and Solution)

# Write a password generator in Python. 
# Be creative with how you generate passwords - strong passwords have a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. 
# The passwords should be random, generating a new password every time the user asks for a new password. 
# Include your run-time code in a main method.

# Extra:

# Ask the user how strong they want their password to be. For weak passwords, pick a word or two from a list.
# Discussion
# There are no new topics this week, but you will need to use Pythonâ€™s random module, described in this post.
